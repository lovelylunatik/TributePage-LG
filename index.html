                <p>Born on April 25, 1968 to Richard Gilmore and Emily Gilmore in Hartford, Connecticut. At age 16,
                    Lorelei
                    discovered she was pregnant with her boyfriend, Christopher Hayden, baby. While Emily and Richard
                    wished
                    for Lorelei and Christopher to be married and raise the baby together, Christopher's parents wanted
                    Lorelei to have an abortion. Lorelei, who grew up feeling like an outcast in a world filled with
                    money
                    and greed, she wanted a different life.</p>
                <p>On October 4, 1985, Lorelei went into labor and gave birth to her daughter, whom in a demoral high
                    gave
                    her the name Lorelei (Rory) Gilmore. On that day Lorelei decided to start a new life for her and her
                    daughter and left her parents home. She found herself in the small, pictureque town of Stars Hallow
                    and
                    was given a job and a place to live by Mia, the owner of the Independence Inn. </p>
                <p>Lorelei worked hard as a single mother, eventually getting her and Rory a home. She also worked hard
                    at
                    the Inn and eventually became promoted all the way to the Manager. There she also met her best
                    friend,
                    Sookie St. James, a extremely talented but somewhat clumsy chef. The town of Stars Hollow also
                    helped
                    Lorelei in raising Rory with characters like Ms. Patty, Luke Danes and Babette doing everything they
                    can
                    to help support their small family.</p>
